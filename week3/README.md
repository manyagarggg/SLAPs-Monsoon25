# Week 3: Benchmark Creation and Analysis

## Overview
This week focuses on creating your own benchmark problems for invariant synthesis. You will design challenging problems that test the capabilities of automated invariant synthesis tools.

## Deliverables
1. **8 Original Benchmark Problems**: Create challenging Dafny programs with while loops
2. **Invariant Solutions**: Write correct invariants for all 8 problems
3. **Problem Analysis**: Document the difficulty and intended learning objectives
4. **Submission**: Complete benchmark suite with solutions and explanations and analysis
5. **Complete Reading**: Finish reading the CSUR14 survey paper ("Loop invariants: analysis, classification, and examples")


## Guidelines for Benchmark Creation

### Problem Requirements
- **Originality**: Problems must be your own creation, not copied from existing sources
- **Uniqueness**: Problems must be different from Week 2 problems and from each other
- **Integer-Only**: All inputs, outputs, and temporary variables must be integers (int type)
- **Difficulty**: Problems should be challenging enough that standard tools/LLMs cannot trivially solve them
- **Variety**: Include different types of loops and mathematical concepts
- **Verifiability**: All problems must be verifiable by Dafny

## Next Steps
After completing Week 3:
- Prepare to expand your benchmark suite to 10 problems in Week 4
- Think about how your problems will test the synthesis tool
- Consider feedback from peers and instructors
- Review your solutions to ensure all invariants are correct and well-justified
